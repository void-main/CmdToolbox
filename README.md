## Why?
After using *nix for about 3 years, I'm ashamed to commit that I still know little about shell scripting. But, I can change that. So, I set up myself for learning it.

After learning so many languages & techniques, I know for sure that the best way to learn is to write. Here comes this repo.

## What?
I'll create two folders for this repo.

- playground
  * EVERYTHING I wrote will be put into this folder
  * So there will be a bunch of meaningless shell scripts
  * I'll try to name them in some conventions

- bin
  * I'll put those scripts that actually does something into this folder
  * I'll only put those I'll use in my everyday working into this folder
  * I'll add this folder path to my $PATH, so I can access them easily
